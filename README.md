## 🏗️ Architecture, Used Packages etc 
Since this Tic-Tac-Toe project is a simple application consisting of few pages, I have chosen to use the MVC architectural pattern. The reason for this is to avoid unnecessarily complicating a simple application and to adhere to the principle of keeping it simple.

### 📦 Packages I used 
- **get: ^4.6.6**: I used this package for, state management, routing (navigation), localization etc.
- **supabase_flutter: ^2.6.0**: Firebase like database, auth service
- **oxidized: ^6.2.0**: For functional programming
- **avatar_glow: ^3.0.1**: For good looking UI (Glowing Avatar effect on Game View)
- **audioplayers: ^6.0.0**: Play audios while playing (Draw, win, x tap, o tap sounds)
- **flutter_dotenv: ^5.1.0**: To store Supabase creds
